    Security auditing of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS following CIS Benchmark guidelines

Files Included

    UbuntuPenetestingReport2.pdf
    This report details the penetration testing conducted on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system in a virtual machine environment. The testing was performed according to the CIS Benchmark security standards and offers insights into the system's vulnerabilities and the steps taken to mitigate them.
        Key Points:
            Identified critical vulnerabilities using Nmap and other tools.
            Conducted privilege escalation using known vulnerabilities like the less and vim command flaws.
            Provided remediation techniques for misconfigurations according to CIS Benchmarks.
            Ensured the system was audited and secured according to best practices.

    SolvedHacktheboxMachine.pdf
    This report covers my experience solving the iClean machine from HackTheBox, a platform used to improve cybersecurity skills.
        Key Points:
            Conducted reconnaissance using Nmap and web-based enumeration techniques.
            Exploited vulnerabilities using tools like Burp Suite to hijack sessions.
            Retrieved both user and root flags, demonstrating a complete compromise of the machine.
            Highlighted the importance of session management and securing sensitive data in web applications.

Tools and Techniques Used

    Nmap: For network scanning and port enumeration.
    Burp Suite: Used for intercepting web traffic and exploiting vulnerabilities.
    SSH and RSA key exploitation: To gain root access to machines.
    CIS Benchmark Auditing: Following security best practices for Ubuntu systems.
    Password Cracking: Cracking hashes to retrieve credentials.

Purpose

These reports demonstrate my ability to:

    Conduct penetration testing in real-world environments.
    Analyze and exploit vulnerabilities.
    Recommend effective mitigation strategies to secure systems.
